# Machine Learning: Data Collection, regression and other similar tasks

## Overview

This repository contains foundational implementations related to **data collection**, **regression**, and **classification** in machine learning. The focus is on understanding the core concepts through practice.

---

## Implemented Components

### Data Collection

The repository contains scripts demonstrating data collection from sources including:

- CSV files
- REST APIs
- Web scraping
- Selenium-based browser automation
- Apache Kafka data streams

These examples illustrate different methods of acquiring structured and semi-structured data for downstream machine learning tasks.

### Machine Learning Models

#### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Implemented using the **Iris dataset**
- Demonstrates basic classification using distance-based methods

#### Linear Regression
- Simple linear regression implementation
- Focuses on understanding the relationship between a single independent variable and a target variable

#### Multiple Linear Regression
- Extension of linear regression using multiple input features
- Demonstrates multivariate regression modeling

### Decision Tree (ID3)
- Implementation of the **ID3 algorithm**
